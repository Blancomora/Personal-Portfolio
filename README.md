As part of a collaboration with the ministry of culture a satisfaction survey was organized by me. 
An investigation on procrastination and motivation levels was placed, as the individuals studied were under age a consent agreement with parents was needed.
Consents were gathered and filtered, such individuals with permission to participate were listed on the final pdfs sent to place surveys
